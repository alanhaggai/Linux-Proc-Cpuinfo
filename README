NAME
    Linux::Proc::Cpuinfo - XS wrapper for libproccpuinfo - a generic parser
    for /proc/cpuinfo

SYNOPSIS
        use Linux::Proc::Cpuinfo;

        my $info = Linux::Proc::Cpuinfo->new;
        if ( defined $info ) {
            print "Architecture:\t\t",    $info->architecture,      "\n";
            print "Hardware Platform:\t", $info->hardware_platform, "\n";
            print "Frequency:\t\t",       $info->frequency,         "\n";
            print "Bogomips:\t\t",        $info->bogomips,          "\n";
            print "Cache:\t\t\t",         $info->cache,             "\n";
            print "CPUs:\t\t\t",          $info->cpus,              "\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Linux::Proc::Cpuinfo is a XS wrapper for "libproccpuinfo"
    (<https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/proccpuinfo/>). It provides a
    generic interface to access "/proc/cpuinfo".

METHODS
  "new" or "new('filename')"
    Returns a new Linux::Proc::Cpuinfo object. Without any argument, parses
    "/proc/cpuinfo". If "filename" is passed, then the file with that name
    is parsed.

    On error, returns "undef".

  "architecture"
    Returns CPU architecture. If "/proc/cpuinfo" file does not list these
    values or if the library fails to recognise the architecture, then the
    value will be set to "undef".

  "hardware_platform"
    Returns hardware platform. If "/proc/cpuinfo" file does not list these
    values or if the library fails to recognise the hardware platform, then
    the value will be set to "undef".

  "frequency"
    Returns the CPU clock speed in MHz. If the "/proc/cpuinfo" file does not
    list the clock speed or if the library fails to recognise the clock
    speed, then this value defaults to 0.

  "bogomips"
    Returns the BogoMips as calculated by the kernel. BogoMips defaults to 0
    if the "/proc/cpuinfo" file does not list the BogoMips or if the library
    fails to recognise the BogoMips.

  "cache"
    Returns the amount of L2 cache in kilobytes. If the "/proc/cpuinfo" file
    does not list the amount of L2 cache or if the library fails to
    recognise the amount of L2 cache, then the value defaults to 0.

  "cpus"
    Returns the total number of processors detected. On systems that list
    the number of detected processors and the number of active/enabled
    processors, the number of detected processors is used. If the
    "/proc/cpuinfo" file does not list the number of processors or if the
    library fails to determine the number of processors, then the value
    defaults to 1 since all running computers have at least 1 processor.

INSTALLING "libproccpuinfo"
    *   Gentoo Linux

            # emerge libproccpuinfo

    *   Generic Linux

        Download the latest archive (named similar to
        "libproccpuinfo-x.x.x.tar.bz2") from
        <http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/proccpuinfo/> and extract
        it.

            $ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .
            $ make
            $ make test
            # make install

        Please send me information on how to install it on other systems and
        I will update it here.
